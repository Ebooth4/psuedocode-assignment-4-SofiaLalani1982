The name of the game is Trash

OBJECTIVE:
To get all of your cards flipped over in ascending order of 1 through 8

CARD MEANINGS:
Cards with any letters or any symbol with the numbers 1-8 are accessible and used no matter what
Ace is used as the number 1
The cards with the number or symbol or face of 9, 10, Jack, or Queen will always be trashed because they are not in between 1 and 8
The card King, which is a wild card, can act as any card

Each player arranges their cards in 2 rows of 4 cards
The remaining cards are set in the middle in reach within each person facedown
The dealer flips one card over faceup, leaving it in the middle
Everytime someone has all of their cards flipped over, they win the round
The person who won that round will get one less card when the cards are redistributed 

ROUND 1:
The player to the left of the dealer can either use that card to substitute one of their cards if it is a number 1-8 or King. Whatever card he substituted will be thrown to "Trash" (the middle)
